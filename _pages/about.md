<p>
Hi there! I am an <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/cpra-bprc_eng.asp#a1">NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. I work with <a href="https://hlilab.github.io/">Heng Li</a>.
</p>

<p>
I obtained my PhD in Math at the University of Toronto, where I was advised by <a href="https://yunwilliamyu.net/content/">Yun William Yu</a>. Previously, I studied Engineering Physics + Mathematics at the University of British Columbia.

## Research interests

<!------>

I develop algorithms/software/theory for [biological sequence analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis) and apply these bioinformatics approaches to investigate microbiome genomics. I like to approach computational biology with a "full-stack approach": start from [algorithms backed by theory](https://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.277637.122), engineer [widely-used bioinformatics software](https://github.com/bluenote-1577), and then hopefully discover something interesting about how microbes evolve. 

Two intertwined themes define my work:

1. How do we obtain _novel insights_ about microbiome genome evolution through _principled_ computational and analytical methods?
2. How do we build sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms to _democratize_ and _improve_ the analysis of massive microbial and meta-omics data?

For example, see my work on [ultrafast microbial divergence computation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-02018-3), [rapid metagenome profiling](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-024-02412-y), and [long-read metagenome assembly](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.05.674543v1).
