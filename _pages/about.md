Hi there! I'm Jim. 

I am a postdoctoral fellow starting in September 2024, working with <a href="https://hlilab.github.io/">Heng Li</a> at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 

I recently defended my PhD in Math at the University of Toronto, advised by <a href="https://yunwilliamyu.net/content/">Yun William Yu</a>.

## Research interests

<!------>

I develop algorithms/tools/theory for [biological sequence analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis) of genomics data. I enjoy thinking about how to extract *robust* signals from large datasets *quickly*. 

My applied interests lean towards the study of microbiomes, e.g., [microbial divergence computation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-02018-3), [metagenome profiling](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.20.567879v2), and [strain resolution](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae252), but I'm broadly interested in important genomics problems. 

Exact techniques used include a mix of engineering, data science, and algorithms; [new theory](https://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.277637.122) is developed when appropriate. I particularly like "full-stack" bioinformatics development, going from math + biology to widely-adopted software.
