Hi there! I'm Jim, a PhD student in the math department at the University of Toronto. I work in <a href="https://yunwilliamyu.net/content/">Prof. Yun William Yu's</a> lab.

## Research interests

<!---My research centers on building computational methods to extract *robust* signals from large genomics datasets *quickly*, with the ultimate goal of accelerating fundamental genomics research.

I develop algorithms/tools/theory for [biological sequence analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis) of large genomics datasets. My applied interests lean towards the study of microbiomes, e.g., [microbial divergence computation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-02018-3), [metagenome profiling](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.20.567879v2), and [strain resolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.28.577669v1), but I'm broadly interested in important genomics problems. 

Exact techniques used include a mix of engineering, data science, and algorithms; [new mathematical theory](https://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.277637.122) is developed when appropriate. I particularly like the "full-stack" process of bioinformatics development, going from pure theory + biology to widely-adopted software.
