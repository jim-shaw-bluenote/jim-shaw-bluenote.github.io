<p>
Hi there! I am a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. I work with <a href="https://hlilab.github.io/">Heng Li</a>.
</p>

<p>
I obtained my PhD in Math at the University of Toronto, where I was advised by <a href="https://yunwilliamyu.net/content/">Yun William Yu</a>. Previously, I studied Engineering Physics + Mathematics at the University of British Columbia.

## Research interests

<!------>

I develop algorithms/tools/theory for [biological sequence analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis). 

My goal is to accelerate biology by building faster, better algorithms for analyzing trillions of molecular sequences. A full-stack approach—including a mix of engineering, data science, and algorithms—is used; [new theory](https://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.277637.122) is also developed when appropriate. 

My algorithmic work is often driven by my biological interest in unraveling the latent complexity of microbiomes; for example, see my work on [microbial divergence computation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-02018-3), [metagenome profiling](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-024-02412-y), and [strain resolution](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae252).
