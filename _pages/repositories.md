Here's a list of software that I've been involved with creating, either directly (code I wrote) or indirectly (devised methods or supervised). 

- [myloasm](https://myloasm-docs.github.io/) - de novo long-read metagenome assembler for even noisy sequences
- [devider](https://github.com/bluenote-1577/devider) - long-read haplotypes for highly-heterogenous sequencing mixtures. 
- [fairy](https://github.com/bluenote-1577/fairy) - fast approximate coverage for metagenomic binning.
- [sylph](https://github.com/bluenote-1577/sylph) - statistical ANI querying and profiling for metagenomic samples. 
- [floria](https://github.com/bluenote-1577/floria) - microbial strain phasing by flow-based MEC haplotyping.
- [skani](https://github.com/bluenote-1577/skani) - fast and robust ANI calculation by sparse k-mer chaining. 
- [mora](https://github.com/AfZheng126/MORA) - strain-level read reassignment (written by [Andrew Zheng](https://github.com/AfZheng126)). 
- [flopp](https://github.com/bluenote-1577/flopp) - fast polyploid haplotype phasing for long-read data. 
- [OPERA-MS](https://github.com/CSB5/OPERA-MS) - hybrid metagenomic assembler for long and short-reads.


Trivia: my github name, [bluenote-1577](https://github.com/bluenote-1577), is the record number for an [album](https://bestofjazz.org/wp-content/uploads/John-Coltrane-Blue-Train.png).
